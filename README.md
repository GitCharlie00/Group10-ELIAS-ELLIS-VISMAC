# Group10-ELIAS-ELLIS-VISMAC

## Project Track
This project aims to develop a fine-tuning technique to mitigate gender and ethnicity biases in VLMs. The evaluation will focus on biases related to a predefined set of professions (e.g., doctor, nurse, etc…) using a provided evaluation dataset. Given that fine-tuning can influence the model’s generalization capabilities, students will also assess the zero-shot performance of the fine-tuned model on two domain-specific datasets. This dual evaluation will help identify trade-offs introduced by the debiasing process
